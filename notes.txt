Done:

Flow direction:
Incoming traffic is 1
Outgoing traffic is 0

Measure traffic by top % instead of top N records. Eg, the top N users account for the top 15% of traffic, where the supplied paramter is 15%.

Draw graphs for destinations as well as sources.
Build a cache for whois info.
Run whois on ip addresses for more insightful logs. Look at top-level ip block info from whois. Convert IP blocks to binary for simple range comparisons.

Verify "outgoing by source" and "outgoing by destination"
Programatically generate commands (more or less)

Graph by time of day

Shorter folder names for output
Stop graphing top_contributors and top_percent for now


Not done:

Chart plotting multiple sources over time of day
Volume of requests (number of flows) instead of total bytes
Histogram of total traffic by time more granular than hourly (15 mins?)

Weekly average rather than daily

Graph a stack chart of IP addresses grouped by whois data

Find the diameter of the network using traceroute
Research methods of anonymizing data
Check patterns against Zipf's law

To discuss:

VPN issues
Algorithms for stack Chart
How the algorithm might miss a high volume of small results
